WHEN AT THE FIRST I TOOK MY PEN IN HAND 
Thus for to write, I did not understand That I 
at all should make a little book In such a 
mode; nay, I had undertook To make another; which, when 
almost done, Before I was aware, I this begun. And 
thus it was: I, writing of the way And race 
of saints, in this our gospel day, Fell suddenly into 
an allegory About their journey, and the way to glory, 
In more than twenty things which I set down. This 
done, I twenty more had in my crown; And they 
again began to multiply, Like sparks that from the coals 
of fire do fly. Nay, then, thought I, if that 
you breed so fast, I'll put you by yourselves, lest 
you at last Should prove ad infinitum, and eat out 
The book that I already am about. Well, so I 
did; but yet I did not think To shew to 
all the world my pen and ink In such a 
mode; I only thought to make I knew not what; 
nor did I undertake Thereby to please my neighbour: no, 
not I; I did it my own self to gratify. 
Neither did I but vacant seasons spend In this my 
scribble; nor did I intend But to divert myself in 
doing this From worser thoughts which make me do amiss. 
Thus, I set pen to paper with delight, And quickly 
had my thoughts in black and white. For, having now 
my method by the end, Still as I pulled, it 
came; and so I penned It down: until it came 
at last to be, For length and breadth, the bigness 
which you see. Well, when I had thus put mine 
ends together, I shewed them others, that I might see 
whether They would condemn them, or them justify: And some 
said, Let them live; some, Let them die; Some said, 
JOHN, print it; others said, Not so; Some said, It 
might do good; others said, No. Now was I in 
a strait, and did not see Which was the best 
thing to be done by me: At last I thought, 
Since you are thus divided, I print it will, and 
so the case decided. For, thought I, some, I see, 
would have it done, Though others in that channel do 
not run: To prove, then, who advised for the best, 
Thus I thought fit to put it to the test. 
I further thought, if now I did deny Those that 
would have it, thus to gratify. I did not know 
but hinder them I might Of that which would to 
them be great delight. For those which were not for 
its coming forth, I said to them, Offend you I 
am loath, Yet, since your brethren pleased with it be, 
Forbear to judge till you do further see. If that 
thou wilt not read, let it alone; Some love the 
meat, some love to pick the bone. Yea, that I 
might them better palliate, I did too with them thus 
expostulate: -- May I not write in such a style 
as this? In such a method, too, and yet not 
miss My end -- thy good? Why may it not 
be done? Dark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring 
none. Yea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops 
Cause to descend, the earth, by yielding crops, Gives praise 
to both, and carpeth not at either, But treasures up 
the fruit they yield together; Yea, so commixes both, that 
in her fruit None can distinguish this from that: they 
suit Her well when hungry; but, if she be full, 
She spews out both, and makes their blessings null. You 
see the ways the fisherman doth take To catch the 
fish; what engines doth he make? Behold how he engageth 
all his wits; Also his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and 
nets; Yet fish there be, that neither hook, nor line, 
Nor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine: They 
must be groped for, and be tickled too, Or they 
will not be catch'd, whate'er you do. How does the 
fowler seek to catch his game By divers means! all 
which one cannot name: His guns, his nets, his lime-twigs, 
light, and bell: He creeps, he goes, he stands; yea, 
who can tell Of all his postures? Yet there's none 
of these Will make him master of what fowls he 
please. Yea, he must pipe and whistle to catch this, 
Yet, if he does so, that bird he will miss. 
If that a pearl may in a toad's head dwell, 
And may be found too in an oyster-shell; If things 
that promise nothing do contain What better is than gold; 
who will disdain, That have an inkling of it, there 
to look, That they may find it? Now, my little 
book, (Though void of all these paintings that may make 
It with this or the other man to take,) Is 
not without those things that do excel What do in 
brave but empty notions dwell. 'Well, yet I am not 
fully satisfied, That this your book will stand, when soundly 
tried.' Why, what's the matter? 'It is dark.' What though? 
'But it is feigned.' What of that? I trow Some 
men, by feigned words, as dark as mine, Make truth 
to spangle and its rays to shine. 'But they want 
solidness.' Speak, man, thy mind. 'They drown the weak; metaphors 
make us blind.' Solidity, indeed, becomes the pen Of him 
that writeth things divine to men; But must I needs 
want solidness, because By metaphors I speak? Were not God's 
laws, His gospel
